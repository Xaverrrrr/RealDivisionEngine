# DoomStyle3D-Game
Trying to make a 3D first person game, only using windows.h, and destroying my sanity doing so.

TODO as of 01.04.2023:
  - Refactor project
  - Mouse inputs are not recognised yet
  - Coloring walls, if possible textures?
  - Make .obj file importable
  - shading (!)
  - make a map builder
  - make maps saveable locally
